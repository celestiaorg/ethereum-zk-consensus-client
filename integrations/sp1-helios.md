# Integration of SP1's Helios Light Client
In order to integrate SP1 Helios with the [Generic State Transition Verifier on Celestia](https://github.com/celestiaorg/celestia-app/tree/feat/ethereum-consensus), we wrap the original Helios proof in another circuit, that performs some assertion over the proof inputs against the previous `trusted_state` and then commits the concatenation of (length_prefix || trusted_state || new_trusted_state). The wrapper proof with public outputs is then sent to the Verifier on Celestia, which will apply the state transition and update the trusted state.

The first 32 bytes of both `trusted_state` and `new_trusted_state` are always the `state_root`, which can later be used to verify Hyperlane message proofs against the on-chain incremental tree.
